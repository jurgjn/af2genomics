Single bit ECC errors are automatically corrected by the HW and do not result in data corruption. Double bit errors are detected but not corrected. Please see the ECC documents on the web for information on compute application behavior when double bit errors occur. Volatile error counters track the number of errors detected since the last driver load. Aggregate error counts persist indefinitely and thus act as a lifetime counter.\n",
